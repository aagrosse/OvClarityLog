# OvClarityLog
An application to log clarity in the Ocean Voyager exhibit at the Georgia Aquarium

## User Story
As a water quality technician at the Georgia Aquarium
I want to see a photo of the exhibit every morning
To see where the clarity is trending so i can make adjustments to the life support to correct it

## Description
This app uses the live webcam to take a still image and save it to a local folder at the same time every morning so that we can make descisions on how the bacteria in the water column is effecting water quality and adjust the life support of the exhibit to correct increases in turbidity.
